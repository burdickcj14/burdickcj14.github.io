<h3>Hey everybody! I'm looking at g-</h3>
<p>This is my Github page I guess. It will briefly outline what I "contributed" to Project 2.</p>

<h3>My Contributions</h3>
<p>Obviously, one of the things I worked on was the Employee DB program; more information about that can be read below. Another things I did was the MySQL client tool note sheet, which you can find either on the home page or <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/48923294/MySQLNoteSheet.pdf">right here.</a> I also participated in the State Farm Coding Competition and did miserably; my excuse is that I was rusty with Java.</p>

<h3>Spook Database</h3>
<p>Halloween is my favorite holiday, and that's roughly when we had to do the database project, so I figured it was only fitting. My database project keeps track of whatever Halloween spooks you want, and contains some totally objective information about them. Obviously, you can put in the name of your Spook, but you can also give them a number digit ID, decide either how much candy they have or how much candy they get on average or something (I'm not really sure to be quite honest), and give them a Spook Factor (a number between 1 and 10, floats allowed) to determine just how spooky they are. I also added methods to wipe the entire table, and to sort the table based on whatever criteria you want (excluding name). As far as the technical stuff goes, I also had to tinker with quite a bit to get the program compatible with Floats, such as adding a new method to the Validator class so it would actually read Floats.</p>

<h3>Team Members</h3>
<p>Everyone else did it, so I guess I have to list my team members too. The other members of my team are <a href="https://vanzilejt24.github.io">Jon VanZile</a>, <a href="https://matsonjm08.github.io">Jon Matson</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Swebiliusaj29">Austin Swebilius</a></p>
