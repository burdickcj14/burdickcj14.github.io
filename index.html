        <h3>Hey, Stupid</h3>
        There is almost nothing to talk about anymore. Very little happened during Project 3.
        
        <h3>Technical Resume</h3>
        <p>This thing is incredibly ugly and I just bullshit my way through it, especially at the Objective section. Just in case I NEED to have it up here, it can be found <href = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/48923294/BurdickTechnicalResume.pdf">here</href>.</p>
        
        <h3>Favorite TCR Moment Database</h3>
        <p>I decided to base my web app on the late True Capitalist Radio. I often remember a moment I personally found to be funny, but can never seem to find it when I want to. This database may or may not help with that, depending on whether or not I actually continue using it. The database contains video titles, broadcast dates, the time in the video the moment occurs, and a brief description of the moment. The video's URL can also be added, but is optional. Aside from the things that everyone changed, I did make some adjustments to make the application a little less tedious to use. One thing I did was I eliminated the entry ID system. On the Update and Delete pages, the database is displayed just like it would be if you were simply viewing it. However, there are radio buttons before each entry. These radio buttons can be used to select an entry for updating or deletion instead of having to memorize the entry's ID. If the user decides to include the video's URL with the entry, it will be formatted as a working hyperlink when viewing the database. Furthermore, the timestamp field will be appended to the URL (in the format Youtube uses) for convenience. That is to say that the hyperlinks not only lead to the video, but also the time the moment occurs.</p>
        <p>The repository for this database can be found <href = "https://github.com/burdickcj14/TCR">here</href>.</p>
        
        <h3>Old Page</h3>
        <p>I figured I should keep the old page intact just in case. It can be found <href = "http://burdickcj14.github.io/old">here</href>.</p>
